#Solace, the Disaster Relief System, in development
A project done for Microsoft code.fun.do++ 2018 by Arshdeep Kainth, K. Hari Madhavan and Parshad Sabara of Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.

  Solace is the placeholder name of our team's Disaster Relief System. Through Solace, we intend to alleviate the various problems that are associated with the disaster and post-disaster phase.

    <li>Alert/Warning system: </li>
    <li><p>Communication during and after disasters:</p>
        <p>One of the most crucial elements to ensure minimum damage and quick recovery is to maintain proper lines of communication, even during the disaster. Through Solace, we intend to keep communication between people open. This plays an important role as it helps people to stay aware of what is happening outside of their immediate surroundings, and houses, but also plays a psychological role by connecting people who would otherwise have been isolated. we mean to implement this by using the app to commence mesh networks between devices through Bluetooth. We have chosen Bluetooth, as it is a  very commonly used protocol, which is found in most devices, and is likely to work even when other networks are down. Communications will be mostly text-based, either between two users or as a group chat. However Bluetooth does have a short range, and thus can be used only at a local level, and will need extenders and central nodes. Thus, this aspect of Solace acts more or less like a minimal social network.</p>
